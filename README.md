## About

 This is a ruby script to fetch webpages and save as pdf. This is
 written in my effort to learn ruby programming language.

## Quick Start

* Clone repository.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trhura/webpage2pdf.git
$ cd webpage2pdf
```

* Get the required ruby gem libraries.
```bash
$ bundle install
```

* Install gir data for webkit.
```bash
$ apt-get install gir1.2-webkit-3.0
```

* Run the script, the webpage will be saved in current directory as pdf using page title as filename.
```bash
$ ./webpage2pdf 'http://www.google.com'
```

## TODO

* Lots of stuff
