### About ###

 This is a ruby script I wrote to get familiar with the ruby language.
 Currently, it can fetch webpages and save as pdf.

### Usage ###

*  Install `gir_ffi` and `gir_ffi-gtk` gems.

    gem install gir_ffi gir_ffi-gtk

*  Run the script, the webpage will be saved as pdf using its title as filename.

    ./webpage2pdf 'http://www.google.com'

### TODO ###

* Lots of stuff
