 This is a ruby script I wrote to get familiar with the ruby language.
 Currently, it can fetch webpages and save as pdf.


## Quick Start
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trhura/webpage2pdf.git
$ cd webpage2pdf
$ bundle install
$ ./webpage2pdf 'http://www.google.com'
(or)
$ ruby webpage2pdf 'http://www.google.com'
```
Run the script, the webpage will be saved as pdf using its title as filename.

## TODO

* Lots of stuff
